This directory contains scripts for raster layer manipulation.

1. combine-txt-batch.sh: combines tile level N into levels N-1 ... N-M

2. combine-txt.pl: combines tile level N into level N-1

3. fmt-convert.sh converts all images in a given directory and its
sub-directories from one format to another using ImageMagick. note that
embedded geo-referencing data will most probably get lost in the process.
fmt-convert-1.sh is a workhorse for the above.

4. normalize-white.sh takes a directory full of indexed TIFFs, and
converts them to RGB TIFFs, normalizing "white" to true white (255,255,255)
in the process.

5. tile-images.pl takes a set of GDAL-friendly geo-referenced images,
and produces a PDS/WMS-friendly tile set. Arbitrary input and output SRSes
are supported, as well, as arbitrary tile sizes and resolutions.
